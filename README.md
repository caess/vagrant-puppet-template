This is my template for Vagrant-based projects.  This is based on Patrick Debois' blog post [Test Driven Infrastructure with Vagrant, Puppet, and Guard](http://www.jedi.be/blog/2011/12/13/testdriven-infrastructure-with-vagrant-puppet-guard/) and the associated [github repo](http://github.com/jedi4ever/vagrant-guard-demo).

### To use
1. Clone the repository.
2. (optional) Rename the remote: `git remote rename origin new-name`
